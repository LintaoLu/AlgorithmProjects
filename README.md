**Percolation** <br/>
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

**BurrowsWheeler** <br/>
Implement the Burrows–Wheeler data compression algorithm. This revolutionary algorithm outcompresses gzip and PKZIP, is relatively easy to implement, and is not protected by any patents. It forms the basis of the Unix compression utility bzip2.
The Burrows–Wheeler data compression algorithm consists of three algorithmic components, which are applied in succession:

Burrows–Wheeler transform. Given a typical English text file, transform it into a text file in which sequences of the same character occur near each other many times.
Move-to-front encoding. Given a text file in which sequences of the same character occur near each other many times, convert it into a text file in which certain characters appear much more frequently than others.
Huffman compression. Given a text file in which certain characters appear much more frequently than others, compress it by encoding frequently occurring characters with short codewords and infrequently occurring characters with long codewords.
